# **Welcome to my Project!**

## **Project Overview**
This project is part of the course on Applied Programming Technology. It allows users to interact with a database through a web interface. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use platform where users can perform various database operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Markup Language**: HTML
- **Database Queries**: SQL (Structured Query Language)
- **Framework**: Spring Boot

## **Features**

- **CRUD Operations**: Allows you to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: The project features a simple web page where users can interact with the database and perform operations.
- **SQL Queries**: Users can directly enter SQL queries to modify the database.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

## **How to Use**

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git

2. **Set Up the Database**:
Ensure you have a working database setup. You can configure the database by updating the connection parameters in the application configuration files.

3. **Run the Application**:
 - Compile and run the Java application (if using a framework like Spring Boot, you can use mvn spring-boot:run).
 - Access the web page via your browser (e.g., http://localhost:8080).

4. **Use the Web Interface**:
You can interact with the database through the web interface, where you can input data or run SQL queries to manage records.

5. **Edit the Code**:
If you want to add more features or modify the existing ones, feel free to make changes to the Java and HTML code. After making changes, recompile and redeploy.
